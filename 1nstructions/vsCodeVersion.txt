Git Install
If you have git installed (requires git v1.7.10+):

clone this repo in the root of your user profile
cd ~/ from anywhere then git clone https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm.git .nvm
cd ~/.nvm and check out the latest version with git checkout v0.39.3
activate nvm by sourcing it from your shell: . ./nvm.sh
Now add these lines to your ~/.bashrc, ~/.profile, or ~/.zshrc file to have it automatically sourced upon login: (you may have to add to more than one of the above files)
