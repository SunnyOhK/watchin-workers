ASK YOURSELF: What does this mean in SQL?!
view all is a JOIN SQL

*** MAKE A LIST OF HOW MANY QUERIES I NEED TO ACCEPT VARIABLES IN THE server.js
Prepare statement... use this to define variables (back tics and a question mark !!  `` ?)

---- INQUIRER QUESTIONS ----
List: What would you like to do? etc.
** Most questions are list (not user input / free write) which should make it easier.


---- SCHEMA.SQL ----
DEPARTMENT TABLE
id: INT PRIMARY KEY
name: VARCHAR(30) to hold department name

ROLE TABLE
id: INT PRIMARY KEY
title: VARCHAR(30) to hold role title
salary: DECIMAL to hold role salary
department_id: INT to hold reference to department role belongs to

EMPLOYEE TABLE
id: INT PRIMARY KEY
first_name: VARCHAR(30) to hold employee first name
last_name: VARCHAR(30) to hold employee last name
role_id: INT to hold reference to employee role
manager_id: INT to hold reference to another employee that is the manager of the current employee (null if the employee has no manager)

---- LAST STEP = WRITE THE SERVER.JS FILE ----


!!!!! console.table() will show the table data from js terminal

22-Stu_Prepared_Statements -- look at the solved folder

EXAMPLE: 
function deleteBook (id) {
  db.query(`DELETE FROM favorite_books WHERE id = ?`, id, (err, result) => {
  if (err) {
    console.log(err);
  }
  console.log(deletedRow);
});
}
deleteBook(3);

HOW CAN YOU POPULATE A LIST FROM SQL DATABASE USING INQUIRER?!? RESEARCH THIS:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66626936/inquirer-js-populate-list-choices-from-sql-database
inquirer.prompt([
        {   type: 'list',
            message: "Choose department to add Role to",
            name: "department",
            choices: [
                `SELECT * FROM departments`
            ]
        }
    ])
